    <p> The Bangladesh national football team (Bengali: বাংলাদেশ জাতীয় ফুটবল দল) is the national recognised football
        team of Bangladesh and is controlled by the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF). It is a member of the Asian
        Football Confederation (AFC) since 1973 and of FIFA since 1974, even though the Bangladesh Football Federation
        was first founded in 1972. Bangladesh was elected as a member of the AFC Executive Committee in 1982–1986 and
        1998–2002. The current Executive Committee was elected democratically, under an AFC approved constitution and
        direct supervision of FIFA & AFC, in October 2020.
